# tfm_market_analysis_with_clustering

The aim of this project is to develop a methodology for vehicles market analysis in the scope of centralised purchasing offices 
based on unsupervised learning techniques. 

Centralised purchasing systems, tend to organize their products in similar categories. 
To define these categories, a previous analysis to identify which are the best features to 
describe a product is required. Along this project, the complete market analysis life cycle is considered. 
From the retrieval of the data, from different sources, to the normalization, 
outliers examination and transformation in a final consistent data source. 
Afterwards, clustering for large data techniques are applied with different sets of features, 
ncluding also an objective indicator based on silhouettes coefficient to asses which is the best subset 
of attributes that qualifies the vehicles in any given time. 

Finally, the results of the clustering algorithms is compared to last market segmentation published in 2017, 
to verify that this techniques could be applied to centralised purchasing systems, checking that, 
compared to last published Framework Agreement, this techniques reduce restrictions on competition 
and assure concurrency in tenderers.
